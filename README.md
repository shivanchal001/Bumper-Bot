## :building_construction: Usage

This robot and its simulation can be used with an Ubuntu 22.04 machine running ROS 2 Humble or and Ubuntu 24.04 machine running ROS 2 Jazzy.

### Prerequisites

* Install [Ubuntu 24.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) or [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) on your PC or in a Virtual Machine.
* Install [ROS 2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) if you are on Ubuntu 24.04. Otherwise, install [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) if you are on Ubuntu 22.04
* Install ROS 2 missing libraries. Some libraries that are used in this project are not in the standard ROS 2 package. Install them with:
* Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing/) on your PC in order to build and load the Arduino code on the device
* Install Python and C++ addistional libraries
```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
     libserial-dev \
     python3-pip
```

```sh
pip install pyserial
```

### Installation

1. Create a Workspace
```sh
mkdir -p bumperbot_ws/src
```

2. Clone this repo
```sh
cd bumperbot_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/AntoBrandi/Bumper-Bot.git
```

3. Install the dependencies
```sh
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -i -y
```

4. Build the workspace
```sh
colcon build
```

5. Source the ROS Workspace (Use this command in a separate terminal from the one you used to build the workspace)
```sh
. install/setup.bash
```

#### :computer: Simulation

6. Launch all the functionalities for the simulated robot
```sh
ros2 launch bumperbot_bringup simulated_robot.launch.py
```

#### :mechanical_arm: Real Robot

7. Connect the Arduino actuating your robot to your PC and load the [robot_control.ino](./bumperbot_firmware/firmware/robot_control/robot_control.ino) script using the Arduino IDE.

8. Launch all the functionalities for the real robot
```sh
ros2 launch bumperbot_bringup real_robot.launch.py
```
